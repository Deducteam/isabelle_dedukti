# Isabelle component exporting Isabelle proofs to Dedukti

## Dependencies

* [Isabelle2023](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2023/dist/Isabelle2023_linux.tar.gz)

* one dk file checker among:

    - [kocheck](https://github.com/01mf02/kontroli-rs)
    - [dkcheck](https://github.com/Deducteam/Dedukti) 2.7
    - [lambdapi](https://github.com/Deducteam/lambdapi) >= 2.2.1

* or one lp file checker among

    - [lambdapi](https://github.com/Deducteam/lambdapi) >= 2.2.1

## Prerequisites

  * **Isabelle**

      - Download [Isabelle2023](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2023/dist/Isabelle2023_linux.tar.gz)

      - Unpack and run `Isabelle2023/bin/isabelle jedit` at least
        once, to ensure that everything works (e.g. see Documentation
        panel with Examples).

      - The command-line executable `isabelle` is subsequently used
        without further qualification, in practice it works like this:

          + explicit executable path (relative or absolute) on the command-line

          + or: insert the absolute path of the Isabelle `bin`
            directory in `$PATH`

          + or: install references to the Isabelle executables in
            another directory mentioned in `$PATH`

  * **isabelle_dedukti**

      - Clone the repository:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/Deducteam/isabelle_dedukti.git
        ```

      - Register it to Isabelle as a user component, by providing a
        (relative or absolute) directory name as follows:
        ```bash
        isabelle components -u $path_to_isabelle_dedukti
        ```
        The resulting configuration is in `$ISABELLE_HOME_USER/etc/components`
        (e.g. use Isabelle/jEdit / File Browser / Favorites to get there).

        For historic reasons, there might be some `init_component`
        line in `$ISABELLE_HOME_USER/etc/settings` --- these should be
        removed, to avoid duplicate component initialization.

      - Compile it:
        ```bash
        isabelle scala_build
        ```

  * **Patching the Isabelle/HOL library**

    A few Isabelle/HOL files need to be modified so that exported proofs are of smaller size and that no oracle are used. See the modifications in [HOL.patch](https://github.com/Deducteam/isabelle_dedukti/blob/master/HOL.patch). For now, HOL and HOL-Library are patched.
    
    - You may want to start with changing the permission on the HOL folder:

    ```
    chmod -R +w <path to your Isabelle distribution>/src/HOL/
    ```

    - Patch the folder, from the isabelle_dedukti folder:

    ```
    patch -up0 -d <path to your Isabelle distribution>/src/HOL/ < HOL.patch
    ```

    - To reverse the patch:

    ```
    patch -uREp0 -d <path to your Isabelle distribution>/src/HOL/ < HOL.patch
    ```

    - To update the patch:
    
    ```
    cd path_to_unpatched_Isabelle_dir
    diff -urNx '*~' -x '*.orig' . path_to_patched_Isabelle_dir/src/HOL > HOL.patch
    ```

  * **Deleting the Isabelle databases**

    If something goes wrong, you may delete the databases (which means the proof terms will be rebuilt anew) located somewhere like:

    ```
    $ISABELLE_HOME_USER/Isabelle2023/heaps/polyml-<something>/log/
    ```

## How to make Isabelle record proofs?

Isabelle theories are built within sessions, and sessions are defined in files named `ROOT`. A quick way to specify a `ROOT` file to Isabelle is the `-d` option.

To export proofs from Isabelle so that they can be translated to Dedukti or Lambdapi afterwards, users need to add the following options to the definition of the session:

```
export_theory,export_proofs,record_proofs=2
```

For instance, the following session builds the session HOL with proof recording:
```
session HOL_wp in HOL_wp = Pure +
  options [strict_facts,export_theory,export_proofs,record_proofs=2]
  sessions Tools HOL
  theories
    Main
    Complex_Main
  document_theories
    Tools.Code_Generator
```

Isabelle requires a dedicated directory for each session, specified by the `in HOL_wp` part above. Usually, it suffices to have an empty directory with the same name as the session.

To actually export proof terms from Isabelle, assuming the `ROOT` file containing the session info is located in `$rootdir` do:

```
isabelle build -b -d $rootdir $session
```

## Command to translate Isabelle proofs to Dedukti or Lambdapi

WARNING: the Lambdapi output is temporarily deactivated for it needs to be fixed.

Command to translate a session to Dedukti: `isabelle dedukti_session -d $root_dir $session`.

By default, it generates in `./dkcheck/`:
  - `parent_$session.dk` representing the parent session, which may contain proofs that do not belong to any theory of `$session` (see remark below),
  - a dk file for each theory of `$session`,
  - `session_$session.dk` representing the session, and
  - `dkcheck_$session.sh` a shell script to check all the generated dk files.

Run `isabelle $command` with no argument for more details.

<!--
- `isabelle dedukti_theory $session $theory`: export the specified $theory of $session to a dk or lp file with the same name except that every minus or dot is replaced by an underscore. (*Does not work at the moment*)
-->
<!--
- `isabelle dedukti_check $session`: generate the scripts `dkcheck.sh` and `kocheck.sh` to check the generated dk files with dkcheck and kocheck respectively.

- `isabelle dedukti_root $session`: generate a ROOT file with a proof-exporting session named Dedukti_$theory for each $theory in $session. This may be useful for debugging or if your computer does not have enough memory to run a single session with all theories. Modify those scripts by adding a `#` in the list of files if you do not want to check all files.
-->

Several sessions with proof exports are already defined in `examples/ROOT`. For each one, and the pre-defined session `Pure`, you should run the following commands in the order of dependencies between sessions (starting from `Pure`):

```
cd examples/
isabelle build -b -d. $session # generates the database of proofs
isabelle dedukti_session -d. $session # generates the lambdapi and dedukti proofs
bash ./dkcheck/dkcheck_$session.sh
```

To translate other sessions, follow these steps:

- add the relevant components to isabelle (for example, AFP),
- define the session:
  - specify the proof export options in your ROOT file;
  - make sure that the parent session also exports proofs (otherwise, Isabelle generates unfinished proofs which cannot be translated to Dedukti);
- run the commands of the previous section.

Remark: to visualize theory dependencies in HOL, you can look at the [dependency graph of the HOL session](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2023/dist/library/HOL/HOL/session_graph.pdf).

Remark: In a database associated with a given theory, there might be proofs labelled from another theory. Fix: those proofs are not too many so they are just translated in this theory. This is a problem from Isabelle itself, and the reason is still unclear. One possible reason is the following: to check that a statement is really provable, Isabelle uses statements that has already be proven, possibly from other theories and sessions. Those proofs are "lifted", in the sense that they are tagged as belonging to the current theory, and they are possibly rewritten. Then, those proofs are given an identifier: if they are detected as a proof that already exists, they are given the already existing identifier and are not added to the database, otherwise they receive a fresh identifier and are added to the database. At this stage, some proofs that should already exist are given a fresh identifier and are added to the database, which creates a lot of duplication of proofs and costs time and memory.

## Project structure

- `ast.scala` provides an AST common to Dedukti and Lambdapi (it is strict subset of these languages)
- `translate.scala` translates Isabelle/Pure to the common Dedukti and Lambdapi AST
- `writers.scala` writes out an AST to either Dedukti or Lambdapi code
- `exporter.scala` provides the isabelle command `dedukti_theory`
- `generator.scala` provides the Isabelle command `dedukti_session`
- `rootfile.scala` provides the Isabelle command `dedukti_root`
- `dkcheck.scala` provides the Isabelle command `dedukti_check`

## Browsing and modifying Isabelle sources

Without proper IDE support Isabelle sources may be very hard to read
and write.

* Isabelle/ML: use Isabelle/jEdit and open ML files (with their proper
  `.thy` file opened as well), but for Isabelle/Pure a special
  bootstrap theory context is provided by
  `$ISABELLE_HOME/src/Pure/ROOT.ML` (see Documentation panel).

* Isabelle/HOL: use Isabelle/Pure to process the theory and ML sources
  in Isabelle/jEdit, e.g. like this:
  ```bash
  isabelle jedit -l Pure
  ```
  then open `$ISABELLE_HOME/src/HOL/Main.thy` via File Browser / Favorites

* Isabelle/Scala: use IntelliJ IDEA with the Java/Scala project generated
  by `isabelle scala_project -L -f`:
  ```bash
  idea "$(isabelle getenv -b ISABELLE_HOME_USER)/scala_project"
  ```
