# Isabelle component exporting Isabelle proofs to Dedukti

## Dependencies

* [Isabelle2022](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2022/dist/Isabelle2022_linux.tar.gz)

* one dk file checker among:

    - [kocheck](https://github.com/01mf02/kontroli-rs)
    - [dkcheck](https://github.com/Deducteam/Dedukti) 2.7
    - [lambdapi](https://github.com/Deducteam/lambdapi) >= 2.2.1

* or one lp file checker among

    - [lambdapi](https://github.com/Deducteam/lambdapi) >= 2.2.1


## Prerequisites

  * **Isabelle**

      - Download [Isabelle2022](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2022/dist/Isabelle2022_linux.tar.gz)

      - Unpack and run `Isabelle2022/bin/isabelle jedit` at least
        once, to ensure that everything works (e.g. see Documentation
        panel with Examples).

      - The command-line executable `isabelle` is subsequently used
        without further qualification, in practice it works like this:

          + explicit executable path (relative or absolute) on the command-line

          + or: insert the absolute path of the Isabelle `bin`
            directory in `$PATH`

          + or: install references to the Isabelle executables in
            another directory mentioned in `$PATH`

  * **isabelle_dedukti**

      - Clone the repository:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/Deducteam/isabelle_dedukti.git
        ```

      - Register it to Isabelle as a user component, by providing a
        (relative or absolute) directory name as follows:
        ```bash
        isabelle components -u $path_to_isabelle_dedukti
        ```
        The resulting configuration is in `$ISABELLE_HOME_USER/etc/components`
        (e.g. use Isabelle/jEdit / File Browser / Favorites to get there).

        For historic reasons, there might be some `init_component`
        line in `$ISABELLE_HOME_USER/etc/settings` --- these should be
        removed, to avoid duplicate component initialization.

      - Compile it:
        ```bash
        isabelle scala_build
        ```

  * **Patching the Isabelle/HOL library**

    A few Isabelle/HOL files need to be modified so that exported proofs are of smaller size and that no oracle are used. See the modifications in [HOL.patch](https://github.com/Deducteam/isabelle_dedukti/blob/master/HOL.patch). For now, HOL and HOL-Library are patched.
    
    - You may want to start with changing the permission on the HOL folder:

    ```
    chmod -R +w <path to your Isabelle distribution>/src/HOL/
    ```

    - Patch the folder, from the isabelle_dedukti folder:

    ```
    patch -up0 -d <path to your Isabelle distribution>/src/HOL/ < HOL.patch
    ```

    - To reverse the patch:

    ```
    patch -uREp0 -d <path to your Isabelle distribution>/src/HOL/ < HOL.patch
    ```

    - To update the patch:
    
    ```
    cd path_to_unpatched_Isabelle_dir
    diff -urNx '*~' . path_to_patched_Isabelle_dir/src/HOL > HOL.patch
    ```

  * **Deleting the Isabelle databases**

    If something goes wrong, you may delete the databases (which means the proof terms will be rebuilt anew) located somewhere like:

    ```
    $ISABELLE_HOME_USER/Isabelle2022/heaps/polyml-<something>/log/
    ```

## How to make Isabelle record proofs?

For building to record Isabelle proofs so that they can be translated to Dedukti or Lambdapi afterwards, users need to add the following options in their ROOT file:

```
export_theory,export_proofs,record_proofs=2
```

For instance, here is a ROOT file to build all the HOL theories up to `Main` and `Complex_Main` with proof recording:
```
session HOL_wp (main) = Pure +
  description "
    Classical Higher-order Logic.
  "
  options [strict_facts,export_theory,export_proofs,record_proofs=2]
  sessions Tools HOL
  theories
    Main
    Complex_Main
  document_theories
    Tools.Code_Generator
```

Then, to actually generate Isabelle proofs, one has to do:

```
isabelle build -b -d $directory_of_ROOT(S)_file $session_name
```

For instance, to generate the Isabelle proofs up to HOL.Groups, do:
```
cd examples/
isabelle build -b -d. HOL.Groups_wp
```

Warning: as `examples/` contains an [AFP library](https://www.isa-afp.org/download/), one should first [add AFP as Isabelle components](https://www.isa-afp.org/help/) and use a version of AFP >= 2023-05-18.

Remark: to visualize theory dependencies in HOL, you can look at the [dependency graph of the HOL session](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2022/dist/library/HOL/HOL/session_graph.pdf)


## Commands to translate Isabelle proofs to Dedukti or Lambdapi proofs

Run `isabelle $command` with no argument for more details.

- `isabelle dedukti_session $session [$theory]`: generate a dk or lp file for each theory of $session (up to $theory)

- `isabelle dedukti_theory $session $theory`: export the specified $theory of $session to a dk or lp file with the same name except that every minus or dot is replaced by an underscore. (*Does not work at the moment*)

- `isabelle dedukti_check $session`: generate the scripts `dkcheck.sh` and `kocheck.sh` to check the generated dk files with dkcheck and kocheck respectively.

- `isabelle dedukti_root $session`: generate a ROOT file with a proof-exporting session named Dedukti_$theory for each $theory in $session. This may be useful for debugging or if your computer does not have enough memory to run a single session with all theories. Modify those scripts by adding a `#` in the list of files if you do not want to check all files.

## Generating basic outputs

Several sessions are already available in the `examples` folder:
- `Pure`,
- `HOL.Groups_wp` (`HOL` until `Groups` with proofs),
- `HOL_wp` (`HOL` with proofs), and
- `HOL-Library_wp` (`HOL-Library` minus the theories about RBTrees, with proofs).

For each one, you should run the following commands:

```
cd examples/
isabelle build -b -d. $session_name # generates the database of proofs
mkdir -p $session_name/dkcheck $session_name/lambdapi
isabelle dedukti_check -d. $session_name # generates scripts for checking proofs, not necessary for Pure
isabelle dedukti_session -d. $session_name # generates the lambdapi and dedukti proofs
```

## Creating other examples

To add other seesions, follow theses steps:

- add the relevant components to isabelle (for example, AFP),
- create a folder in `examples/` with the session name,
- create the sub-folders `dkcheck/` and `lambdapi/`
- add a ROOT file as described above,
- add the session name in the `examples/ROOTS`,
- run the commands of the previous section.

## Checking the outputs

For now, only the checking with dedukti works. To check a particular session, run:

```
cd examples/$session_name/dkcheck/
bash dkcheck.sh
```

## Performances (to update)

The whole `HOL_wp` session in `examples/HOL/` can be exported and checked:
  * `isabelle build -b -d. HOL_wp`: 51m42s, 249 Mo
  * `isabelle dedukti_session -d. HOL_wp`: 28m26s
  * `bash kocheck.sh`: 4m14s
  * `bash dkcheck.sh`: 13m17s
  * `lambdapi check Complex_Main.lp`: out of memory
  * `lambdapi check HOL_Nat.lp`: 2m04s
  * `lambdapi check HOL_Int.lp`: 11m44s

## Known issues

  * In a database associated with a given theory, there might be proofs labelled from another theory. Fix: those proofs are not too many so they are just translated in this theory. This is a problem from Isabelle itself, and the reason is still unclear. One possible reason is the following: to check that a statement is really provable, Isabelle uses statements that has already be proven, possibly from other theories and sessions. Those proofs are "lifted", in the sense that are tagged as belonging to the current theory, and they are possibly rewritten. Then, those proofs are given an identifier: if they are detected as a proof that already exists, they are given the already existing identifier and are not added to the database, otherwise they receive a fresh identifier and are added to the database. At this stage, some proofs that should already exist are given a fresh identifier and are added to the database, which creates a lot of duplication of proofs and costs time and memory.
  * Somehow, the databases for `Nat` and `Sum_type` use proofs from `Product_Type` while they are independent in the dependency graph. Fix: add explictly the connection in the dependency graph.
  * The tool `dedukti_theory` is meant to translate of given theory of a session. This tool is not working in the current version.
  * We tried to make the proof checking as modular as possible, in the sense that theories already checked are not checked again, and the proofs are stored in possibly different folders for classification. For the moment, we can only make this work with dkcheck, and we are investigating how to do it with kocheck and lambdapi.

## Project structure

- `ast.scala` provides an AST common to Dedukti and Lambdapi (it is strict subset of these languages)
- `translate.scala` translates Isabelle/Pure to the common Dedukti and Lambdapi AST
- `writers.scala` writes out an AST to either Dedukti or Lambdapi code
- `exporter.scala` provides the isabelle command `dedukti_theory`
- `generator.scala` provides the Isabelle command `dedukti_session`
- `rootfile.scala` provides the Isabelle command `dedukti_root`
- `dkcheck.scala` provides the Isabelle command `dedukti_check`

## Browsing and modifying Isabelle sources

Without proper IDE support Isabelle sources may be very hard to read
and write.

* Isabelle/ML: use Isabelle/jEdit and open ML files (with their proper
  `.thy` file opened as well), but for Isabelle/Pure a special
  bootstrap theory context is provided by
  `$ISABELLE_HOME/src/Pure/ROOT.ML` (see Documentation panel).

* Isabelle/HOL: use Isabelle/Pure to process the theory and ML sources
  in Isabelle/jEdit, e.g. like this:
  ```bash
  isabelle jedit -l Pure
  ```
  then open `$ISABELLE_HOME/src/HOL/Main.thy` via File Browser / Favorites

* Isabelle/Scala: use IntelliJ IDEA with the Java/Scala project generated
  by `isabelle scala_project -L -f`:
  ```bash
  idea "$(isabelle getenv -b ISABELLE_HOME_USER)/scala_project"
  ```
