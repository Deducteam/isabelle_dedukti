- Pure is not accessible from a given session. So dedukti_session will read Pure session. TODO: do the same for dedukti_theory.

- dedukti_session repeatedly reads the session for every theory. TODO: share the info.

- Export.Session_Context.theory_names contains some theories from the parent session. TODO: test if a theory belongs to the session. 

- dedukti_root: put session names between double quotes

- dedukti_session: check that theory exists ?


Old:

- what is the option "export_standard_proofs"" vs "export_proofs" ?

- eliminate odd mutable datastructures: irrelevant for performance, and the cost of clear semantics;

- clarify OfClass proofs (normally expanded by Isabelle);

- clarify Oracle proofs (normally expanded by Isabelle);

- clarify implicit conversion (alpha, beta, but also eta?!?);
